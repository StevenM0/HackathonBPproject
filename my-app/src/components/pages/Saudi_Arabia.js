        Saudi Arabia, an “oil” country, is one of the biggest producers, consumers, and emitters of the modern world. Their contribution to the world's energy past, present and future is unanimous. According to bp’s Statistical Review:

        <h3>
            ➼  In 1965, Saudi Arabia emitted just 62.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide overall. 
 
</h3>
        <h3>➼  Later on, by 1980, Saudi Arabia’s emissions had reached 97.9 million metric tons.
 </h3>
        <h3>➼  In 2019, Saudi Arabia emitted 582.2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, primarily dependent on energy consumption and production </h3>
        <h3>➼  In 2020, Saudi Arabia’s emissions fell to 569.2 million metric tons, primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as subsequent economic slowdowns. 
</h3>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <h3> According to the latest news, Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Energy has announced to invest up to $266bn to clean energy, renewables and CCUS, which is an excellent step from a big oil country to produce “eco friendly” oil.
 </h3>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <h3> Although it is extremely unpredictable to guess the trend of the Saudi carbon footprint, one may tell that since their economy is heavily reliant on oil, the footprint will tend to increase, for the near term.

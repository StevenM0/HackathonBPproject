      <p>   CCUS stands for carbon capture, utilization and storage, which is a top-notch technology designed to capture carbon dioxide emissions, with the aid of industrial processes, and then either store it underground, or reuse it for industrial purposes such as enhanced oil recovery. It is no surprise that if the ultimate goal of the CCUS is achieved, it may contribute to mitigate the impacts of climate change, and help the countries to safely produce oil without any environmental considerations.
      </p> 
      <br/>
      <p>   One of the downsides of this project is that it can only be utilized in a “static” environment, meaning that CCUS is useful for the dynamic emitting bodies , such as industrial power plants. The technology loses its effect in the cases of gasoline, and diesel cars, for instance. 
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>   It is no surprise that there has been a huge interest towards this technology, so that the countries who are heavily reliant on fossil fuels can profit from the natural energy resources without any environmental consideration. Some of the latest contributions and investments on this technology include:
      </p>
      <br />
      <ul>
          <li> - In January 2021, the US Congress passed the 45Q tax credit expansion, which provides sufficient financial investment for the utilization of CCUS technology.</li>
          <li> - In February 2021, the European Commision announced plans to create a “European Clean Hydrogen Alliance” that will support the development of CCUS technology as part of a broader effort to “decarbonize” the European economy.</li>
          <li> - In June 2021, the US Department of Energy announced $12m in funding for 6 research and development projects focused on advancing the CCUS technology.</li>
          <li> - Also in June 2021, bp (British Petroleum) announced plans to build the UK's largest blue hydrogen production facility, which will use CCUS primarily.</li>
          <li> - In July 2021, Canada announced 4 big investments in the CCUS technology, one is primarily focused on CCUS application in a natural gas processing plant in Alberta.</li>
          <li> - In August 2021, the European Investment Bank announced to invest 1.5 billion euros for CCUS technology.</li>
      </ul>

      <br/>
      <p>   The market for the CCUS technology is expected to remain still for the near term, yet is expected to grow in the next decades. In 2023, low-carbon investments are expected to grow by further $60bn, making it one of the most expensive, but at the same time rewarding investments in the near future (Rystad Energy). All of these investments are a positive indication that governments act responsibly towards making the energy sector more “environmentally friendly”, primarily with the aid of CCUS technology.

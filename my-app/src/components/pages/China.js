            China has undoubtedly been one of the most decisive countries in the energy arena, with their high level of production and consumption of primary energy, through the years. Inevitably, very high numbers of production and consumption, especially fossil fuels, has brought the challenge with itself, which is carbon footprint. According to the bp Statistical Review:
        </h3>

        <br/>
        <h3>➼  In 1965, China emitted just 488.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from energy consumption.</h3>
        <h3>➼  By 2005, China’s emissions had reached up to 6079.3 million metric tons, surpassing the United States as the world’s largest emitter of carbon dioxide. </h3>
        <h3>➼  In 2019, China emitted 9868.5 million metric tons of CO2, more than twice the amount of the United States emission. </h3>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <h3> The gradual increase in China’s emission numbers is heavy reliance on coal as a primary source of energy to produce electricity. However, China is on its way to make a positive impact on the reduction of greenhouse emissions, by heavy investments in renewables and CCUS. But still, China will still be one of the biggest contributors to the CO2 footprint of the world for the near future. </h3>

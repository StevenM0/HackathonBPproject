        Russia (previously USSR), has always been popular in the energy arena, regardless of any time period. Primarily caused by their excessive production amounts, especially in their weapon and heavy machinery industry, Russia always showed up as a big contributor to the global CO2 footprint. According to the “bp” Statistical Review:

        <h3>➼  In the period between 1965-1985, the USSR emission data was not reported in “bp” review, due to certain political reasons, primarily due to the Cold War between the western world and the Russian side. 
</h3>
        <h3>➼  Later on, the USSR emissions peaked until 1990, peaking at 2291,8 million tonnes in 1988, yet dwindled significantly after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
 </h3>
        <h3>➼  From 1991 to 1998, Russian emissions declined sharply, from 2233,9 million tonnes to 1445,3 million tonnes. </h3>
        <h3>➼  After 1998, Russian emissions have fluctuated, with some years showing increases and others showing declines. 
</h3>
<h3>➼  In 2020, Russia emitted 1456,2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, down from a peak of 2291,8 million tonnes in 1988.

        <h3> As of today, Russia is a country who is still reliant on fossil fuels as a primary energy source, and this may conclude that the emission. However, according to Reuters, a presidential decree under which by 2030, all greenhouse gas emissions, including CO2, should be reduced to 70% of the 1990 numbers, which is a positive step towards net zero in the near future. Russian emissions are expected to stay stable for the foreseeable future, considering a remarkable decline in their CO2 emissions for the last 30-40 years.

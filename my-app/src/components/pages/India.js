        India is one of the most rapidly developing and growing economies in the world, by their successful initiatives in education, healthcare and energy industries. Primarily caused by their rapid growth, India is one of the biggest CO2 emitting countries in the modern world. According to the bp’s Statistical Review:
        </h3>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <h3>➼  In 1965, India emitted just 167.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from energy consumption and production.</h3>
        <h3>➼  By 2005, India’s carbon emissions had reached up to 1200 million metric tons. </h3>
        <h3>➼  Later on, 14 years later, in 2019, India emitted 2465.8 million metric tons of carbon, making them the third largest emitter in the world, after China and the United States. </h3>
        <h3>➼  In 2020, India’s carbon footprint will decline to 2281,2 million metric tons, due to COVID-19 pandemic, and subsequent economic downturn.</h3>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <h3> In the instance of India, the sharp decline in the country’s carbon footprint is not expected for the near term. Heavily dependent on coal plants to generate electricity and other subsequent types of energy, India is still expected to be one of the biggest contributors to CO2 footprint in the world. </h3>
